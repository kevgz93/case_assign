# Queue Monitor (Frontend side)
A basic app for manual support case assigments.

  - Manage the case assigment of all of your team.
  - See which teams are online and which ones are not.
  - Check the history of the previous case already assigned to a specific user to avoid over assigning cases.

### Tech

Queue Monitor uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
